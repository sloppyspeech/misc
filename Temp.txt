Okay, here are key assumptions to list down to support your estimates, specifically considering the UAT and Pre-Production testing phases before go-live:

**Assumptions Supporting Migration Estimates (Including UAT & Pre-Prod Testing):**

1.  **Environment Availability & Stability:**
    * UAT and Pre-Production Snowflake environments will be fully configured, stable, and available according to the project schedule when testing phases are planned to begin.
    * Any required non-Snowflake infrastructure (e.g., servers/VMs to run shell scripts, network connectivity) for UAT and Pre-Prod will also be ready and stable.

2.  **Environment Parity:**
    * UAT and Pre-Production environments will be reasonable replicas of the Production environment concerning Snowflake configuration (users, roles, permissions, relevant parameters, warehouse sizes or comparable T-shirt sizes for performance testing) and the execution environment for shell scripts. Significant deviations may impact test validity and effort.

3.  **Snowpark Code Readiness & Stability:**
    * The corresponding Snowpark/Scala code for the shell scripts being tested will be successfully transcoded/developed, unit-tested, and delivered for integration testing *before* the UAT phase for those scripts begins.
    * The delivered Snowpark code is assumed to be relatively stable; the estimate does not account for significant Snowpark code re-writes or major defect fixes discovered *during* the shell script testing phases (though minor fixes are expected).

4.  **Test Data Availability & Quality:**
    * Sufficient, representative, and cleansed/masked test data will be loaded and available in both UAT and Pre-Production environments *prior* to the start of the respective testing cycles.
    * The effort required for test data generation, masking, or loading is *not* included in the shell script migration estimate unless explicitly stated otherwise.

5.  **Tooling and Access:**
    * All necessary tools (e.g., SnowSQL clients, appropriate Java runtime environments for Snowpark JARs) will be installed, configured, and accessible in the UAT and Pre-Prod testing environments.
    * The migration and testing teams will have the necessary Snowflake access (roles, permissions on databases, schemas, stages, warehouses) and system-level access in UAT and Pre-Prod *before* testing commences. Delays in obtaining access are not factored into the estimate.
    * A functional and secure method for managing Snowflake credentials (e.g., key-pair files accessible to scripts, secrets management) is available and configured in test environments.

6.  **Scope Definition:**
    * The scope of the 300 scripts, including their core functionality to be migrated, is fixed and well-understood. The estimate assumes no significant changes to requirements or the addition/removal of scripts during the UAT or Pre-Prod phases.

7.  **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Clear, measurable, and agreed-upon acceptance criteria for UAT will be defined *before* the UAT execution phase starts.

8.  **Resource Availability & Skillset:**
    * Required personnel (migration developers, testers, Snowflake administrators, potentially business users for UAT) with the necessary skills (Shell Scripting, SnowSQL, Snowflake, Snowpark execution understanding, testing) will be available as planned during the testing phases.
    * The estimate assumes standard team productivity and does not account for significant ramp-up/learning time *during* the testing phases.

9.  **Defect Resolution Process:**
    * A timely process for defect reporting, triage, fixing (by script team or Snowpark team as appropriate), and re-testing is established and adhered to. The estimate assumes a reasonable turnaround time for defect resolution that doesn't significantly block testing progress.

10. **Testing Execution:**
    * The estimate assumes standard testing execution efficiency. It does not cover extensive performance tuning efforts or exploratory testing beyond the defined test cases unless explicitly included.

11. **Approvals and Process Adherence:**
    * Sign-offs (e.g., UAT completion, readiness for Pre-Prod testing) and adherence to the defined testing and deployment processes occur within the planned timeframes. Bureaucratic delays are not factored in.

Listing these assumptions helps set expectations and highlights dependencies critical for the estimate's validity, especially when planning resource allocation for the crucial UAT and Pre-Prod validation stages.
