used to represent and reason about the preferences and intentions of 
human users, such as personalizing web searches or improving the 
accuracy of speech recognition.
Explainability: Knowledge graphs can be used to 
provide explanations for the decisions made by AI systems, such as 
explaining the reasoning behind a medical diagnosis or a financial 
transaction.
Overall, knowledge graphs have the potential to 
greatly enhance the capabilities of AI systems by providing a powerful 
and flexible framework for representing and reasoning about complex data
 and relationships.
