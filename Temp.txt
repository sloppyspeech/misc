To compare two Snowflake databases with 6000 tables and 10 PB of data efficiently, follow this structured approach using Python:

### **1. Schema Comparison**
**Objective**: Verify that all tables and their structures (columns, data types, constraints) match between databases.

```python
import snowflake.connector
from snowflake.connector import DictCursor

def get_table_schema(conn, database, schema, table):
    query = f"""
    SELECT 
        column_name, 
        data_type, 
        is_nullable, 
        ordinal_position
    FROM {database}.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
    WHERE table_schema = '{schema}' AND table_name = '{table}'
    ORDER BY ordinal_position;
    """
    cursor = conn.cursor(DictCursor).execute(query)
    return cursor.fetchall()

def compare_schemas(source_conn, target_conn, database, schema, table):
    source_schema = get_table_schema(source_conn, database, schema, table)
    target_schema = get_table_schema(target_conn, database, schema, table)
    
    if len(source_schema) != len(target_schema):
        return False, "Column count mismatch"
    
    for src_col, tgt_col in zip(source_schema, target_schema):
        if (src_col['column_name'] != tgt_col['column_name'] or
            src_col['data_type'] != tgt_col['data_type'] or
            src_col['is_nullable'] != tgt_col['is_nullable']):
            return False, f"Column {src_col['column_name']} mismatch"
    
    return True, "Schema matches"
```

### **2. Row Count Comparison**
**Objective**: Ensure the number of rows in each table matches.

```python
def compare_row_counts(source_conn, target_conn, database, schema, table):
    query = f"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM {database}.{schema}.{table};"
    source_count = source_conn.cursor().execute(query).fetchone()[0]
    target_count = target_conn.cursor().execute(query).fetchone()[0]
    return source_count == target_count, (source_count, target_count)
```

### **3. Data Sampling & Statistical Comparison**
**Objective**: Compare a subset of data using date ranges and statistical metrics.

#### **3.1 Identify Date Column**
Automatically detect a date column for sampling (e.g., `created_at`).

```python
def get_date_column(conn, database, schema, table):
    query = f"""
    SELECT column_name
    FROM {database}.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
    WHERE table_schema = '{schema}' 
      AND table_name = '{table}'
      AND data_type IN ('DATE', 'TIMESTAMP_NTZ', 'TIMESTAMP_LTZ')
    LIMIT 1;
    """
    cursor = conn.cursor().execute(query)
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    return result[0] if result else None
```

#### **3.2 Generate Stats Query**
Build a dynamic SQL query to compute column statistics.

```python
def generate_stats_query(table_ref, date_col, start_date, end_date):
    columns = get_table_columns(source_conn, database, schema, table)
    query_parts = []
    
    for col in columns:
        col_name = col['column_name']
        data_type = col['data_type']
        
        if data_type in ('NUMBER', 'INT', 'FLOAT', 'DECIMAL'):
            stats = f"""
            SELECT '{col_name}' AS column_name,
                   MIN({col_name}) AS min_val,
                   MAX({col_name}) AS max_val,
                   AVG({col_name}) AS avg_val
            FROM {table_ref}
            WHERE {date_col} BETWEEN '{start_date}' AND '{end_date}'
            """
        elif data_type in ('VARCHAR', 'STRING', 'TEXT'):
            stats = f"""
            SELECT '{col_name}' AS column_name,
                   MIN(LENGTH({col_name})) AS min_length,
                   MAX(LENGTH({col_name})) AS max_length,
                   COUNT(DISTINCT {col_name}) AS distinct_count
            FROM {table_ref}
            WHERE {date_col} BETWEEN '{start_date}' AND '{end_date}'
            """
        elif data_type in ('DATE', 'TIMESTAMP'):
            stats = f"""
            SELECT '{col_name}' AS column_name,
                   MIN({col_name}) AS min_date,
                   MAX({col_name}) AS max_date
            FROM {table_ref}
            WHERE {date_col} BETWEEN '{start_date}' AND '{end_date}'
            """
        query_parts.append(stats)
    
    return " UNION ALL ".join(query_parts)
```

#### **3.3 Compare Stats**
Execute the query on both databases and compare results.

```python
def compare_data_stats(source_conn, target_conn, query):
    source_stats = source_conn.cursor(DictCursor).execute(query).fetchall()
    target_stats = target_conn.cursor(DictCursor).execute(query).fetchall()
    
    discrepancies = []
    for src, tgt in zip(source_stats, target_stats):
        if src != tgt:
            discrepancies.append((src['column_name'], src, tgt))
    
    return discrepancies
```

### **4. Orchestration & Parallelization**
Use parallel processing to handle 6000 tables efficiently.

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def compare_tables(source_conn, target_conn, database, schema, tables):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
        futures = []
        for table in tables:
            future = executor.submit(
                compare_single_table,
                source_conn, target_conn, database, schema, table
            )
            futures.append(future)
        
        for future in futures:
            # Log results or handle exceptions
            future.result()

def compare_single_table(source_conn, target_conn, database, schema, table):
    # Step 1: Schema comparison
    schema_match, schema_msg = compare_schemas(...)
    if not schema_match:
        log_discrepancy(f"Schema mismatch in {table}: {schema_msg}")
        return
    
    # Step 2: Row count comparison
    count_match, (source_count, target_count) = compare_row_counts(...)
    if not count_match:
        log_discrepancy(f"Row count mismatch in {table}: {source_count} vs {target_count}")
        return
    
    # Step 3: Data stats comparison
    date_col = get_date_column(...)
    if not date_col:
        log_discrepancy(f"No date column found in {table}")
        return
    
    query = generate_stats_query(...)
    discrepancies = compare_data_stats(...)
    if discrepancies:
        log_discrepancy(f"Data stats mismatch in {table}: {discrepancies}")
```

### **5. Statistical Methods for All Data Types**
- **Numeric Columns**: Compare `min`, `max`, `avg`, and `stddev`.
- **String Columns**: Compare `min_length`, `max_length`, and `distinct_count`.
- **Date Columns**: Compare `min_date` and `max_date`.

### **6. Reporting & Logging**
Store results in a structured format (e.g., CSV, database table) for auditing.

```python
import csv

def log_discrepancy(message):
    with open("discrepancies.csv", "a") as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        writer.writerow([message])
```

### **Key Optimizations**
1. **Dynamic Query Generation**: Minimize round-trips to Snowflake by computing all stats in a single query.
2. **Parallel Execution**: Use `ThreadPoolExecutor` to compare multiple tables concurrently.
3. **Date-Based Sampling**: Focus on recent data (e.g., `WHERE date_col > CURRENT_DATE - 30`).
4. **Efficient Type Handling**: Leverage Snowflake’s metadata to tailor stats per column type.

### **Execution Steps**
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install snowflake-connector-python
   ```
2. **Configure Connections**:
   ```python
   source_conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
       user=USER, password=PASSWORD, account=ACCOUNT, 
       database=SOURCE_DB, schema=SCHEMA
   )
   target_conn = snowflake.connector.connect(...)
   ```
3. **Run Comparison**:
   ```python
   tables = get_all_tables(source_conn)
   compare_tables(source_conn, target_conn, "MY_DB", "PUBLIC", tables)
   ```

This approach balances performance and thoroughness by leveraging Snowflake’s compute power for statistical aggregations and Python for orchestration.

Okay, let's design a robust and performant Python-based approach for comparing two large Snowflake databases (DB1 and DB2) during your migration project. We'll follow your suggested top-down strategy.

**Core Principles:**

1.  **Leverage Snowflake Processing:** Perform as much computation (aggregations, counts, filtering) within Snowflake itself to minimize data transfer to the Python client. Snowflake is built for large-scale parallel processing.
2.  **Metadata First:** Use Snowflake's `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` extensively for structural comparisons. It's fast and efficient.
3.  **Sampling for Data:** Avoid full data comparison. Use statistical sampling based on date ranges (or other strategies if needed) for data verification.
4.  **Parallelism:** Use Python's concurrency features to compare multiple tables simultaneously, speeding up the overall process.
5.  **Configuration Driven:** Make database names, schemas, tables (or exclusion lists), date ranges, tolerance levels, etc., configurable.
6.  **Clear Reporting:** Log discrepancies clearly at each stage (schema mismatch, row count diff, stats diff).

**Required Python Libraries:**

* `snowflake-connector-python`: For connecting to and querying Snowflake.
* `pandas`: Useful for handling query results, especially schema information, though not strictly necessary if results are processed directly.
* `concurrent.futures`: For parallel execution of table comparisons.
* `logging`: For robust logging of progress and discrepancies.
* `configparser` or `PyYAML`: For managing configuration.
* `decimal`: Python's `Decimal` type might be needed for precise comparison of Snowflake `NUMBER` types if default float precision is insufficient.

**Step-by-Step Comparison Approach:**

**Phase 0: Setup and Configuration**

1.  **Configuration File:** Create a configuration file (e.g., `config.ini` or `config.yaml`) to store:
    * Snowflake connection parameters for DB1 and DB2 (use secure methods like key-pair authentication or environment variables, avoid hardcoding credentials).
    * Database names (DB1, DB2).
    * Schema inclusion/exclusion lists.
    * Table inclusion/exclusion lists within schemas.
    * Date range for sampling (e.g., `'YYYY-MM-DD'` to `'YYYY-MM-DD'`, or relative like 'last 7 days').
    * Default date/timestamp column name pattern to look for (e.g., `LOAD_TS`, `UPDATE_TS`, `CREATED_AT`). Allow table-specific overrides.
    * Numerical comparison tolerance (e.g., 0.0001 for averages).
    * Number of parallel workers for `concurrent.futures`.
    * Flags to enable/disable specific checks (e.g., `compare_schema=true`, `compare_row_counts=true`, `compare_data_stats=true`).
2.  **Logging:** Set up Python's `logging` module to output detailed information, warnings, and errors to a file and/or console.
3.  **Connection Function:** Create a utility function to establish Snowflake connections using parameters from the config file.

**Phase 1: Object Structure Comparison**

1.  **Schema List Comparison:**
    * **Action:** Query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA` in both DB1 and DB2.
    * **Query:** `SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata WHERE catalog_name = ?;` (Pass DB name as parameter)
    * **Comparison:** Compare the lists of schemas (applying inclusion/exclusion rules from config). Log schemas present only in DB1 or only in DB2.
2.  **Table/View List Comparison (Per Schema):**
    * **Action:** For each schema common to both DBs (or schemas being compared), query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`.
    * **Query:** `SELECT table_name, table_type FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_catalog = ? AND table_schema = ?;`
    * **Comparison:** Compare the lists of tables/views within the schema (applying inclusion/exclusion rules). Log objects present only in one DB or objects with different types (e.g., TABLE in DB1 vs. VIEW in DB2).
3.  **Table Column Structure Comparison (Per Table):**
    * **Action:** For each table/view common to both DBs and schemas, query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`.
    * **Query:** `SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, numeric_precision, numeric_scale, character_maximum_length, datetime_precision, ordinal_position FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_catalog = ? AND table_schema = ? AND table_name = ? ORDER BY ordinal_position;`
    * **Comparison:**
        * Fetch column definitions for the table from both DB1 and DB2.
        * Compare the lists based on `ordinal_position`.
        * Check for:
            * Missing or extra columns.
            * Differences in `data_type`. Be mindful of aliases (e.g., `INT`, `INTEGER`, `NUMBER(38,0)` might be equivalent). Define mapping/equivalence rules if needed.
            * Differences in `is_nullable` ('YES'/'NO').
            * Differences in precision/scale/length where applicable (e.g., `VARCHAR(100)` vs `VARCHAR(200)`).
        * Log detailed discrepancies for each table.

**Phase 2: Row Count Comparison**

1.  **Action:** For each table identified as having a matching structure (or optionally, even if structures differ slightly, depending on requirements), execute a `COUNT(*)` query.
2.  **Query:** `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM identifier(?);` (Use `identifier()` to handle table names safely). Pass the fully qualified table name (e.g., `DB1.SCHEMA_A.TABLE_X`).
3.  **Comparison:** Fetch the counts from both DB1 and DB2. Compare the results.
4.  **Logging:** Log tables with matching row counts and those with discrepancies (including the counts from both DBs). This is a quick, high-level data check.

**Phase 3: Sampled Data Comparison (Statistics)**

This is performed only for tables with matching structures and row counts (or based on configuration).

1.  **Identify Columns and Sampling Column:**
    * Use the column information obtained in Phase 1 (or re-query if necessary).
    * Identify a suitable date/timestamp column for filtering the sample based on the configured patterns/overrides. If no suitable column exists, this step might need to be skipped for that table, or an alternative sampling (like `TABLESAMPLE`) could be considered, though date ranges are often better for migration checks.
2.  **Generate Statistics Queries (Per Table, Per Column Type):**
    * Dynamically build a *single* aggregate query per table to fetch statistics for relevant columns within the specified date range. This is crucial for performance – avoid querying each column individually.
    * **Numerical Columns (e.g., NUMBER, INT, FLOAT):**
        * **Metrics:** `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `STDDEV_SAMP` (sample standard deviation), `SUM`, `COUNT` (non-null), `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` (if distinctness is important).
        * **SQL Snippet:** `MIN(num_col) as min_num_col, MAX(num_col) as max_num_col, AVG(num_col) as avg_num_col, ...`
    * **String Columns (e.g., VARCHAR, STRING, TEXT):**
        * **Metrics:** `MIN` (lexicographical), `MAX` (lexicographical), `AVG(LENGTH(str_col))` (average length), `MAX(LENGTH(str_col))`, `COUNT` (non-null), `COUNT(DISTINCT str_col)`. Consider `HASH_AGG` for a more comprehensive check if performance allows (`HASH_AGG(str_col) as hash_str_col`). `HASH_AGG` combines hash values of all non-null inputs; any difference implies data divergence in the sample.
        * **SQL Snippet:** `MIN(str_col) as min_str_col, MAX(str_col) as max_str_col, AVG(LENGTH(str_col)) as avg_len_str_col, HASH_AGG(str_col) as hash_agg_str_col, ...`
    * **Date/Timestamp Columns (e.g., DATE, TIMESTAMP_NTZ):**
        * **Metrics:** `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT` (non-null), `COUNT(DISTINCT date_col)`.
        * **SQL Snippet:** `MIN(date_col) as min_date_col, MAX(date_col) as max_date_col, ...`
    * **Boolean Columns:**
        * **Metrics:** `COUNT_IF(bool_col = TRUE)` (or `SUM(IFF(bool_col, 1, 0))`), `COUNT_IF(bool_col = FALSE)`.
        * **SQL Snippet:** `COUNT_IF(bool_col) as count_true_bool_col, COUNT_IF(NOT bool_col) as count_false_bool_col, ...`
    * **Combined Query Example:**
        ```sql
        SELECT
            -- Numerical
            MIN(num_col1) as min_num_col1, AVG(num_col1) as avg_num_col1, SUM(num_col1) as sum_num_col1,
            MIN(num_col2) as min_num_col2, AVG(num_col2) as avg_num_col2, SUM(num_col2) as sum_num_col2,
            -- String
            MAX(LENGTH(str_col1)) as max_len_str_col1, COUNT(DISTINCT str_col1) as distinct_str_col1, HASH_AGG(str_col1) as hash_agg_str_col1,
            -- Date
            MIN(date_col1) as min_date_col1, MAX(date_col1) as max_date_col1,
            -- Boolean
            COUNT_IF(bool_col1) as count_true_bool_col1
            -- Add other stats as needed...
        FROM identifier(?) -- Table name
        WHERE identifier(?) BETWEEN ? AND ?; -- Date column and range
        ```
3.  **Execute and Compare Statistics:**
    * Execute the generated aggregate query on the table in both DB1 and DB2.
    * Fetch the single result row containing all statistics for that table from both databases.
    * Compare the corresponding statistics:
        * **Exact Match:** For counts, min/max (usually), hash aggregates.
        * **Tolerance Match:** For averages, standard deviations, sums (especially floats/decimals). Use the configured tolerance. Compare `Decimal` types for precision if needed.
        * Handle potential `None`/`NULL` results if the sample range contains no data or only nulls for a column.
4.  **Logging:** Log detailed discrepancies for each statistic that fails comparison for each table (e.g., `Table_X: avg_num_col1 mismatch - DB1=123.45, DB2=123.55`).

**Phase 4: Parallel Execution and Reporting**

1.  **Parallel Processing:**
    * After getting the list of common tables (Phase 1), use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`.
    * Create a function (e.g., `compare_single_table(db1_params, db2_params, db_name1, db_name2, schema_name, table_name, config)`) that encapsulates steps 1.3, 2, and 3 for a single table.
    * Use `executor.map` or submit individual tasks to the pool to run `compare_single_table` concurrently for all tables in the list. Ensure connection handling is thread-safe (e.g., each thread creates its own connection or uses a thread-safe connection pool). Passing connection *parameters* and letting threads create connections is often simplest.
2.  **Result Aggregation:** Collect the results (success/failure status, list of discrepancies) from each future/thread.
3.  **Final Report:** Generate a summary report:
    * Counts of schemas/tables compared.
    * Lists of objects missing/added/type-mismatched.
    * List of tables with schema discrepancies (with details).
    * List of tables with row count mismatches.
    * List of tables with data statistic mismatches (with details).
    * Overall success/failure indication.

**Implementation Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** Wrap database calls and comparisons in `try...except` blocks to handle network issues, query errors, permission problems, type conversion errors, etc. Log errors clearly and decide if an error for one table should halt the entire process or just skip that table.
* **Snowflake Warehouse:** Ensure the Snowflake virtual warehouses used have sufficient size (e.g., Medium or Large) and concurrency settings (`MAX_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL`) to handle the parallel queries efficiently without queuing. Consider using separate warehouses for querying DB1 and DB2 if resource contention is a concern. Monitor credit usage.
* **Transactions:** These are read-only comparisons, so explicit transactions are generally not required. Use `autocommit=True` (the default) in the connector.
* **Wide Tables:** The statistical approach handles wide tables well because it generates a single aggregate query, avoiding fetching wide rows. Comparing structure (Phase 1.3) is important.
* **Data Types:** Pay close attention to comparing different but potentially compatible data types (e.g., `VARCHAR` vs. `STRING`, `NUMBER` vs. `INT`). `HASH_AGG` can be sensitive to data type differences even if values seem the same.
* **Optimization:** If comparing thousands of tables takes too long even with parallelism, consider:
    * Running comparisons only for schemas/tables known to be part of the current migration wave.
    * Further refining the sampling strategy.
    * Increasing warehouse size or concurrency.

This approach provides a structured, performant, and robust way to compare your Snowflake databases using Python, leveraging Snowflake's strengths for heavy lifting while orchestrating the process and comparisons externally. Remember to tailor the configuration, specific statistical metrics, and tolerance levels to your project's exact needs.


Okay, here are three time-bound goals designed to address the specific behavioral aspects you observed, with mechanisms for measurement every 15 days over the next 60 days. These are structured to encourage positive change and provide clear milestones.

**Performance Improvement Goals (60-Day Period)**

| :---- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | **Improve Initiative & Reduce Decision Hesitation:** Proactively identify and take ownership of **one significant new challenge or improvement area** within the first 30 days, presenting an initial plan (including potential risks & mitigation) within 5 working days of identifying/accepting the challenge. | **15-Day Check-ins:** <br> - **Day 15:** Discuss potential challenges identified. Has active consideration begun? <br> - **Day 30:** Has a challenge been selected? Is the initial plan submitted/discussed? Review quality of risk assessment vs. paralysis. <br> - **Day 45:** Progress update on the chosen challenge. Any roadblocks encountered and how were they approached? <br> - **Day 60:** Review overall progress/completion of the initial phase of the challenge. Assess timeliness and proactivity shown. | 60 Days  | The focus is on taking *calculated* risks, not avoiding them. Encourage breaking down the challenge and focusing on the *first step* or initial plan to overcome the feeling of being overwhelmed. The goal is action despite uncertainty. |
| 2     | **Enhance Decision Agility:** For complex technical decisions requiring analysis, commit to presenting **preliminary options/recommendations within 3 working days** of the issue being raised or assigned, even if further deep-dive is needed. | **15-Day Check-ins:** <br> - Track instances of complex decisions arising during the period. <br> - Review the timeliness of preliminary proposals. Were they presented within the 3-day target? <br> - Discuss the thought process: Was analysis focused on key factors initially, or did it immediately spiral into excessive scenarios? <br> - Manager observation of reduced 'overwhelmed' signals during decision discussions. | 60 Days  | This goal directly targets the "long thinking mode." It encourages iterative decision-making – starting with possibilities rather than waiting for perfect clarity. It differentiates initial analysis from exhaustive exploration. |
| 3     | **Improve Empathetic Communication:** Actively solicit and acknowledge team member perspectives during technical discussions or 1:1s. Aim for **at least 3 documented instances** (shared during check-ins) per 15-day period where feedback/input was explicitly sought and acknowledged constructively. | **15-Day Check-ins:** <br> - Discuss specific examples provided by the technical lead from the previous 15 days. <br> - How was input sought? (e.g., "What are your thoughts on this approach?", "What challenges do you see?") <br> - How was input acknowledged? (e.g., "Thanks, that's a valid point," "Let's explore that risk further.") <br> - Manager observation in team meetings. <br> - *Optional:* Gather brief, informal feedback from 1-2 team members mid-way (around Day 30) and at the end. | 60 Days  | This makes 'empathy' measurable through observable actions. The goal isn't just *hearing* but actively *seeking* and *acknowledging* input, demonstrating value for team members' contributions and feelings. Focus on specific, concrete examples. |

**Overall Approach:**

* **Initial Meeting:** Clearly communicate these goals, the reasons behind them (linking back to the feedback), and your intention to support their development. Frame it as an opportunity for growth.
* **15-Day Check-ins:** These are crucial. Use them to review progress against the specific measuring criteria, discuss challenges, provide constructive feedback, and offer support or resources. Document the key discussion points after each check-in.
* **Focus on Progress, Not Perfection:** Acknowledge effort and improvement, even if targets aren't perfectly met every single time. The trend over the 60 days is important.
* **Gather Feedback:** Your own observations are key, but consider ways to gather feedback from others if appropriate and possible without undermining trust (e.g., observing team interactions, informal chats with other team members about *collaboration* in general).

This structure provides clear expectations, regular touchpoints for feedback and course correction, and measurable criteria to assess improvement over the next two months.

Risk ID	Risk Description	Impact	Mitigation Plan & Status		
R01 (High)	Hiring Delays: Failure to onboard the full 12-member team by the July target date.	Schedule: Inability to run 3+ UAT streams in parallel, delaying the overall program timeline.	In Progress: Executing the accelerated hiring plan. Contingency: Prioritize migration of low-complexity applications first; re-plan UAT waves if delay exceeds 3 weeks.		
R02 (Med)	Complexity Underestimation: The effort to convert and test highly complex Spark/Scala logic is higher than estimated.	Schedule / Quality: UAT cycles for complex apps may require more than the planned number of sprints, impacting schedule.	Active Mitigation: Close collaboration with Snowflake during conversion. Our agile UAT approach allows for early detection. We are building buffer time into the plan for Q4.		
R03 (Med)	Vendor Dependency: A slowdown in Snowflake's code conversion or SIT process creates a bottleneck for our UAT factory.	Schedule: Our UAT team could be blocked with no applications ready to test.	Active Mitigation: Strong governance established with weekly progress reviews. Clear entry/exit criteria for handovers. Maintaining a buffer of 2-3 SIT-approved apps in the backlog.

Workshop Goal:

To achieve absolute clarity and mutual agreement on the SIT scope, process, criteria, and collaboration model to ensure a high-quality, seamless handover of code to the UAT team.
Your Team's Mindset for the Workshop:

    Be a Partner, Not a Police Officer: Frame the discussion around mutual success. A good SIT helps them (fewer defects rejected from UAT) and helps you (cleaner code to test).
    Think Like a UAT Tester: Your primary goal is to prevent issues from ever reaching you. Every question should be viewed through the lens of, "What do I need to be confident in this code before my team spends time on it?"
    Clarity is Kindness: Ambiguity is the enemy. It's better to over-communicate and document everything now than to argue about expectations later.

Proposed Workshop Agenda & Key Discussion Points

1. Foundational Alignment: The Purpose & Scope of SIT

    Objective of SIT: Let's align on a single statement. Propose: "To verify that the converted Snowpark code is technically sound, meets functional and non-functional requirements, integrates correctly with its components (including Ctrl-M), and is ready for User Acceptance Testing."
    Scope - What's "In"?
        Data pipeline functionality (end-to-end run).
        Validation of all transformation logic.
        Data integrity checks (no data loss or corruption).
        Error handling and logging mechanisms.
        Integration with Ctrl-M for orchestration.
        Basic performance benchmarks (does it run in a reasonable time?).
        Parameterization (does the job run correctly with different inputs/dates?).
    Scope - What's "Out"?
        Formal business process validation (that's UAT).
        Extensive performance/load testing (unless specified).
        User interface testing (if applicable).
    Roles & Responsibilities (RACI Chart): Let's draft a simple RACI for the SIT phase.
        Who is Responsible for: SIT Test Plan, Environment Setup, Test Data Provisioning, Test Execution, Defect Fixing, SIT Sign-off, Technical Support (Your Team's Role).

2. The Environment, Data, and Code Strategy

    SIT Environment:
        How closely will the Snowflake SIT environment mirror UAT/Production? (e.g., warehouse sizes, roles, permissions).
        Who is responsible for environment setup, maintenance, and cost?
        What is the process for refreshing the environment if needed?
    Test Data Strategy (Critical Point):
        What data will be used? Anonymized production subsets? Generated data?
        How will data privacy be ensured?
        Who is responsible for creating, loading, and validating the test data in the SIT environment?
        Will the test data cover key edge cases (e.g., null values, duplicates, special characters, zero-record files)?
    Code Deployment:
        What is the process for deploying code from development to the SIT environment?
        Which version control system (e.g., Git) and branch will be used for SIT-ready code?

3. SIT Execution & Defect Management

    SIT Test Plan Review:
        Will the vendor share their Master SIT Test Plan for our review and feedback?
        How will they ensure their test cases cover all the critical transformations from the original Spark code?
    Execution Approach:
        Will they test applications individually or in groups based on dependencies?
        How will the Ctrl-M orchestration be tested and validated?
    Defect Management Process (Your Key Interface):
        Tool: Which tool will be used for defect tracking (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps)? Let's agree on one.
        Workflow: What is the defect lifecycle (New -> Assigned -> In Progress -> Ready for Retest -> Closed)?
        Severity & Priority: Let's agree on standard definitions for Critical, High, Medium, Low.
        SLAs: What are the agreed-upon Service Level Agreements for fixing defects found in SIT? (e.g., Critical: 24 hours, High: 3 days). This is crucial to prevent SIT from dragging on.
        Reporting: How will defect status be reported and reviewed? (e.g., daily defect triage meeting).

4. The Finish Line: Exit Criteria & The Handover Package

    Definition of Done (DoD) for SIT - Let's Define It Together: This is the most important part of the workshop. Propose a clear checklist.
        [ ] 100% of planned SIT test cases have been executed.
        [ ] Minimum of 95% pass rate for all test cases.
        [ ] Zero outstanding Critical or High severity defects.
        [ ] All Medium and Low severity defects are documented and a resolution plan is agreed upon (can be fixed later if UAT is not impacted).
        [ ] The end-to-end pipeline has been successfully run via Ctrl-M at least X times.
        [ ] The final SIT Summary Report has been shared and signed off by the Vendor Lead and [Your Name/UAT Lead].
    The SIT Summary Report: What must this document contain?
        Executive summary of results.
        Link to the detailed test execution logs (pass/fail status for every test case).
        Final defect report showing all bugs raised and their resolution status.
        Performance benchmark results.
        A list of any known issues, limitations, or workarounds being handed over.
    The Handover Package to UAT: What does your team receive when SIT is "done"?
        The signed-off SIT Summary Report.
        The final, version-controlled Snowpark code and deployment scripts.
        The Ctrl-M job definition files.
        Any environment configuration notes.

5. Collaboration & Communication

    Meeting Cadence: Shall we have a daily 15-minute sync-up during the SIT execution phase?
    Communication Channels: What is our primary channel for quick questions (e.g., a shared Slack/Teams channel)? When should email be used?
    Technical Support Process: If the vendor needs technical help from our team (e.g., understanding a business rule, source data questions), what is the process? Who is the designated Point of Contact?
    Escalation Path: If we have a disagreement or an issue is blocked, what is the agreed-upon escalation path for both sides?
